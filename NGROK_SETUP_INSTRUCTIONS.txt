# Ngrok Installation and Laravel Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Install Ngrok

1. Go to https://ngrok.com/download
2. Download the Windows ZIP file
3. Extract the ngrok.exe file to a folder (e.g., C:\ngrok\)
4. Add that folder to your system PATH:
   - Press Windows Key + R, type sysdm.cpl, press Enter
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System Variables", find "Path", click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the path where you extracted ngrok (e.g., C:\ngrok\)
   - Click OK to save

## Step 2: Authenticate Ngrok (Optional but Recommended)

If you have an ngrok account:
1. Sign up at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
2. Get your authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
3. Run this command in Command Prompt/Terminal:
   ```
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN_HERE
   ```

## Step 3: Start Your Laravel Application

1. Open Command Prompt/Powershell in your project directory
2. Start your Laravel application:
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```
   Your app will be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Step 4: Expose Your Application with Ngrok

1. Open a NEW Command Prompt/Powershell window in any directory
2. Run ngrok to create a tunnel to your Laravel app:
   ```
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
3. Ngrok will provide you with a public URL (e.g., https://xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io)
4. Share this URL to give others access to your local Laravel application

## Step 5: Using the Deployment Script

We've created a batch file to automate this process:

1. Double-click `start-ngrok-deployment.bat` in your project folder
2. The script will:
   - Verify ngrok and PHP are installed
   - Start your Laravel server
   - Start ngrok tunnel on port 8000
   - Show you the public URL

## Important Notes:

- Your .env file has been configured with the necessary settings
- The application key has been generated and saved
- Make sure your database is running (e.g., MySQL in Laragon/XAMPP)
- The ngrok URLs are temporary and change each time you restart ngrok
- Anyone with the ngrok URL can access your application, so be cautious when sharing

## Troubleshooting:

Q: Ngrok not found when running the batch file?
A: Make sure ngrok is installed and added to your system PATH

Q: Laravel server not starting?
A: Ensure you're running the command from the correct project directory

Q: Database connection errors?
A: Make sure your database server is running (Laragon/XAMPP)

Q: Assets (CSS, JS) not loading properly?
A: This is common with ngrok; the application should still function correctly
